# genai test

This is a simple command line based program built using [`Rust`](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [`rust-genai`](https://github.com/jeremychone/rust-genai).

By default, the program uses [`gemini`](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/gemini-15-pro-and-15-flash-now-available/) AI model. But this can be changed in talk_to_ai.rs file. The length of your reponse can also be adjusted in this file. 


## how to run

* Navigate to the location of the main.rs file and run this in your terminal 

```
cargo run "your query"
```
